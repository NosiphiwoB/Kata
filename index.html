      <h3>About</h3>
      <div class="about">
        <p>
          Living in the grasslands, scrub, and open woodlands of sub-Saharan
          Africa, the lion is the second largest cat in the world. It is dwarfed
          slightly by the tiger, which is closely related and has a very similar
          body type.Lions usually hunt at night. Their prey includes antelopes,
          buffaloes, zebras, young elephants, rhinos, hippos, wild hogs,
          crocodiles and giraffes. But they also sometimes eat smaller prey
           like mice, birds, hares, lizards, and tortoises. They are not 
           above stealing kills from other carnivores, like hyenas, wild dogs, 
           cheetahs, and leopards, or scavenging spoiled meat.

            Unlike other cats, lions are very social animals. They live in
            groups, called prides, of around 30 lions. A pride consists of up to
            three males, a dozen related females, and their young. The size of
            the pride is determined by the availability of food and water. If
            resources are scarce, the pride becomes smaller.

            Female lions are the primary hunters of the group. They are smaller
            and more agile than males. But since their prey is still generally
            faster than them, they use teamwork to bring an animal down. Fanning
            out, they form a semicircle, with the smaller, weaker lionesses
            herding the prey towards the center. Then the stronger females knock
            the animal down and make the kill.
